                    <h3>A political party called the Jovian People’s Movement. The JPM was formed around the same time as the Coalition, and was in direct opposition to the political ideals and methods of their rival. The JPM wanted to build a democratic society on Europa through nonviolent means and model it after earlier civilizations on Earth. The Movement amassed a large number of supporters and became a noteworthy challenger to the Coalition in the general election of Europa.</h3>

Legislation developed by the Coalition, such as the Resource Balancing and Control Act, further cemented their rule by regulating trade with settlements which opposed the Coalitions’ ideology.</h3>

                    <h3>Perhaps the most baffling of all the Europan factions are the clowns. The ocean is vast enough and the submarines claustrophobic enough to drive anyone mad, but is it really psychological troubles that drive some citizens to don red rubber noses and honk bikehorns at passers-by? Are they entertainers, hired in some misguided attempt at lifting morale? And who in the heavens is the Honkmother?</h3>
